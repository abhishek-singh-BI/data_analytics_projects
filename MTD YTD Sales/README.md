MTD YTD Sales Dashboard

- PROBLEM STATEMENT:

1. The dashboard is a POC done for a bank client. The goal was to provide a finance dashboard to display mutual funds data for branch banking hierarchy.

2. Mutual funds data team wanted to see MTD and YTD data for a period of 12 months using a month filter.

3. A large amount of data needed to be squeezed into a really small area using visual charts that will tell a story.


- Questions:


1. What are the KPIs and how they fare as compared to previous months?
2. What is the performance of branch banking hierarchy in contrast to actual vs expected sales (dubbed in this example as current sales vs previous month sales).
3. What are the contribution of organisation level categories?
4. What is the month on month Trend?

- Challenges:

1. Selection of innovative charts to represent actual vs expected outcome.

2. Squeezing a large amount of data into a relatively small area.


- Solution:


1. MTD and YTD are separately shown in two parts to create clarity among business users.

2. Comparison of key KPIs with previous month in the header table. The same is facilitated with an Up/Down arrow to indicate growth/degrowth.

3. Use of a thermometer chart to show actual vs expected outcome for branch banking hierarchy (dubbed in this example as category and subcategory). This not only consumed less space but also provided a visual simplicity while comparing data.

4. Use of doughnut chart to display organisational level category slice.

5. Viz in tooltip feature used which displays a new chart when a user hovers over an existing chart on the dashboard. This enables developers to add more charts in dashboard to save space.

6. A visual narrative is automatically created in both the sections that start off with KPI level summary and naturally drill down to different slices including month on month trend.

7. A Global filter provided at top for hassle free usage.

8. Minimal use of color for a clean and professional look.
