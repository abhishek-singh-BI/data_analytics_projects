Product Wise Sales Dashboard

- PROBLEM STATEMENT:

1. Designing an interactive yearly dashboard that enables analytics from an overview perspective down to a more detailed view

2. Identify the KPIs that will lead to actionable insights and help in making product related decisions.

3. A large amount of data needed to be squeezed into a really small area using visual charts that will tell a story.

- Audience and Purpose:

Executives who are interested in highly summarised view to interact with dashboard in such a way that it will naturally lead to problem areas related to a specific product. Executives have regional heads directly reporting to them and hence would like to see a regional summary.

The purpose would be to recognise products that are not profitable and are declining in sales and profit as compared to previous year.

- Questions:


1. What are the KPIs and how they fare as compared to previous year?
2. What is the growth in KPIs as compared to previous year? Is it possible to compare growth at monthly detail?
3. What is the performance of each category, sub-category? Is there any specific KPI that we should be looking at? What is percentage of total sales by each sub-category?
4. What are the bottom 10 products for each sub-category?
5. What is the month on month Trend?

- Challenges:

1. Selection of innovative charts to highlight problem areas.

2. Squeezing a large amount of data into a relatively small area.

3. A natural design that will be interactive and intuitive enough to naturally lead users to insights
.
4. Finding analytical relationship between different metrics.

- Solution:


1. A highly summarised KPI dashboard which gives insights at yearly level.

2. A natural design that starts with KPIs at top and then drills down to region, category and product levels.

3. Executives are given power in their hand so that they can filter on specific regions, sub-category and products to see the granular details.

4. Guiding and selection details given in header/tooltip to make user aware of current selections.

5. Metrics like average sales, growth-degrowth compared with previous year, percent of total and profit/loss applied at appropriate level for analytical insights.

6. A relationship between percent of total sales and profit is created in a scatter plot to let users know the products that are highly volatile - More percent of total sales but with less profit. This will help executives to highlight the products that are not profitable with more share of sales. The attention thus can be shifted away to more profitable products to increase their share in sales.

7. A Global filter provided at top for hassle free usage.

8. Minimal use of color for a clean and professional look.

- Improvements for future releases:

1. Currently a viz in tooltip is provided that gives monthly comparison with previous year sales, avg.sales. If this looks appropriate to end users , the scope can be extended to other KPIs.

2. Addition of more KPIs like Average Discount/ Returns to identify a relationship with declining sales.

3. Color are more saturated and highly subjective. Get user feedback to see if they should be made less intense and more transparent.

4. Identifying the calculations that are taking time to compute and simplifying them to improve performance.
