Best in Class

- PROBLEM STATEMENT:

1. The dashboard is a POC done for a bank client. The goal was to find out best performing staff of branch banking hierarchy.

2. The staff under a series of hierarchy levels doing good are called best performers.


- Questions:


1. Who are the best policy sellers under a series of branch banking hierarchy levels?
2. Is it possible to know any inactive staff under a branch banking hierarchy?

Note: The data here is masked as Category (for hierarchy) and customers (staff under branch banking hierarchy).

- Challenges:

1. Showing best in class of entire hierarchy visually on a single screen.

2. Visual elements should lead to a conclusion.


- Solution:

1. The length of Bar graph is used to show the relative sales done by a staff under banking hierarchy. They are sorted and formatted to be lean enough to show all the best performers at a glance.

2. The length is aided by color attribute and leads to a quick analysis when comparing with other hierarchy members.

3. A series of bar graphs are sequentially used to visually show the best performers of hierarchy in a natural way.

4. Easy and simple UI that is elegant yet intuitive to the end users.

5. Inactive staff members are shown so that the same can be used to improve the performance going ahead.

6. User friendly Hamburger menu for filters.

7. Minimal use of color for a clean and professional look.
